The Submission folder contains :

1. Code
2. Datathon1TechnicalReport.pdf
3. README

The pipeline to produce the final output for {any variable} is as follows :

1. In the (Stage 1)... folder, run the file ocean_analysis_{variable}.py. This will generate the 147 time frames as jpg images.
2. Next, in the (Stage 2)... folder, run the preprocess.py. This will prepare the images for the final output.
3. Lastly, from the (Stage 3)... folder, run gifgenerator.py to produe the final output.  

The separation was done to keep a track of the individual frames for better analysis. 


Additionally,
The Datathon1TechnicalReport.pdf contains a google drive link to a more complete submission folder in its abstract. Please refer to the same.
